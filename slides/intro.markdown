### npm

* like other package managers  &rarr;
	* gem for Ruby
	* or pip, easy_install, etc. for Python
	* or whatevs (CPAN!?)
* doesn't install globally by default (nice... unlike _other_ package management systems)
* btw, what are some analagous tools that we'd use to avoid installing packages globally for python and ruby? &rarr;
	* rvm
	* virtualenv
* why do we even care?  why is this important?


### package.json

* it's where you list your dependencies
* what's the equivalent in python or ruby?
	* gemfile - ruby
	* requirements.txt - python

### node require

like:

* php's include
* ruby's require
* python's import

er... maybe not really.  it actually just returns an object.

### jade... templating system
